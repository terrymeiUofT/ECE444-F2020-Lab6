### Pros and Cons of TDD
Pros: 
1. TDD provides a more rigorous structure of development. It requires programmers to first define a set of tests that would initially, and then write codes with the goal of passing these predefined goals. This is a clear structure to follow. Following this flow of developement ensures the codes can achieve the objectives defined in the test set.
2. TDD gives a quantifiable measure of progress. Programmers can get a clear understanding of how many tests have been resolved, and how many test are left. Solving all predefined tests means that the progress is 100%
3. TDD forces the team to communicate more and follows a similar style of coding. Writing unit testing code forces frontend and backend developers to communicate, and to make this process easier, they would most likely make requirements on each others' code for mutual understanding, which is a very beneficial practice for the team.

Cons:
1. Personally, I found that TDD has a steep learning curve, which could slow down the development process.
2. Writing unit testing code requires the programmer to have a good understanding of both frontend and backend codes, which makes it hard to divide the tasks to frontend or backend developers. 
3. If there is code already written, and when these codes are written the developers did not follow TDD, then it becomes a pain to turn these codes to be unit-testable.
